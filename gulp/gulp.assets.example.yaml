# Gulp Tasks
# ------------------------
# Tasks are grouped by usage
# Each task group contains an array of tasks
# Each of these tasks must have a name, source and destination

tasks:

    # Process Main APP LESS files (files you edit frequently)
    less_main:
        # Array of LESS Tasks. Create a new array for each CSS file you would like to create.
        -
            # Name of the individual task - used for notifications
            name: "Main CSS"
            # Source files - Can be a single file or array. Files will be concatenated and processed as a single file.
            src:

            # Destination filename - define what the resulting CSS files should be called
            dest: "main.css"
            # Each task can optionally contain custom options for the plugins used
            # Post CSS plugins can be be decalared along with options. Note, if you declare plugins here, they will overide ALL plugins set in gulp.config.yaml
